# Heart_disease_KNN
This is a classifier model to predict if a person has heart disease or no using KNN.
The datasets are cleveland.csv, hungarian.csv, switzerland.csv and long-beach-va.csv obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
These datasets were merged to one.
Each dataset contained 76 attributes but only 14 (including the target feature) were used in these analyses.
